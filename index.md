## About Me

<p>Hi, welcome to my personal website! <br />
I am a Ph.D. student at the <a href="https://www.stonybrook.edu/">Stony Brook University</a> in the <a href="https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/">Department of Computer Science</a> where I intend to study the reliability issues of LLMs and the Privacy and Security issues of AI models. I am advised by Dr. <a href="https://alps-lab.github.io/">Ting Wang</a> and received one year of kind advise and help from Dr. <a href="https://pike.psu.edu/dongwon/">Dongwon Lee</a> at Penn State University.</p>

## Research Interests

- **Reliable LLMs:** Jailbreaking, Hallucination, KV Cache Optimization, Retrieval-Augmented Generation
- **Security & Privacy:** Adversarial Machine Learning, Unlearnable Examples, Differentially Private Models

## News

- **[Jan. 2025]** Our paper about defending jailbreak attacks via attention-based KV eviction is accepted to ICLR 2025! See you in Singapore! 
- **[Jan. 2025]** Our paper about Retrieval-Augmented Differentially Private Diffusion Model is accepted to ICLR 2025! See you in Singapore! 
- **[Aug. 2023]** I have started a new journey at Stony Brook University as a PhD Student in Computer Science!
